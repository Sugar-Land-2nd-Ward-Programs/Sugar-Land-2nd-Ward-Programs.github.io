<h1 align="center">Houston South Stake Emergency Preparedness Corner</h1>
<p align="center">Emergency preparedness is the process of planning and preparing for potential hazards and disasters. Even though hurricane season for the Houston area is pretty much over, emergencies don't pay attention to the calendar.</p>
<p align="center">This December is as good a time as any to increase your family's preparedness. If you don't have 72-hour kits packed for everyone in your household (even if it's just you), let this guide you in your Christmas shopping!</p>
<p align="center">If you're all prepared in that sense, now is a good time to wrap your outside faucets and do all else that you need to in order to be prepared for any upcoming freezes.</p>
<p align="center">There are countless lists and resources online to give guidance and practical information on emergency preparedness. Go ahead and get started!</p>
