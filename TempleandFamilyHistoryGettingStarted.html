<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">There are a few related areas to the
redemption of our deceased ancestors :</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Data Digitizing (Indexing,
	reviewing names, verifying places,etc.)</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Building and Adding to Your Family
	Tree</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Temple Work</p></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">More information on these categories
are listed below:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Data Digitizing (Indexing, reviewing
names, verifying places, etc)</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Searching records for information
	related to our deceased ancestors.  There are many physical records
	added daily.  To facilitate access to these records by a broader
	audience, these records must be Indexed so their content becomes
	searchable.<br/>
<br/>
Here are resources to provide you an
	introduction and guidance to getting started with
	Indexing:<br/>
	<a href="https://www.familysearch.org/indexing/my-indexing"><font color="#1155cc"><u>https://www.familysearch.org/indexing/my-indexing</u></font></a><br/>
<br/>
In
	addition to Indexing, there are three other areas of opportunity
	related to digitizing records:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Quick Name Review</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Full Name Review</p></li>
		<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Verify Places</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Some may consider
these activities as a type of game.  For more information, please
see:<br/>
	<a href="https://www.familysearch.org/getinvolved/opportunities"><font color="#1155cc"><u>https://www.familysearch.org/getinvolved/opportunities</u></font></a><br/>
and
click on “Get Started” or “Find Places” as desired<br/>
<br/>
In
addition, to support the various areas of Family Search, phone apps

phones:<br/>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Building and Adding to Your Family
Tree</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Linking ourselves to our living
	and deceased ancestors by identifying and recording a small set of
	essential information.  Finding our deceased ancestors is made
	easier by Indexing as described above.<br/>
<br/>
Here are resources
	to provide you an introduction and guidance to getting started with
	building your Family
	Tree:<br/>

<br/>

	</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Temple Work</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Once we have identified and linked
	our ancestors, we can perform vicariously the saving and exalting
	ordinances of: Baptism, Confirmation and gift of the Holy Ghost,
	Ordination to Priesthood for male ancestors, Endowment, Eternal
	Marraige and Sealing of children to Parents.  This work is performed
	in the Temple.<br/>
<br/>
You can identify names to take to the
	Temple according to the type of work you plan on participating in at
	the Temple through the “Ordinances Ready” feature of the Family
	Search - Family Tree phone app as well as on the Family Search
	website:<br/>
	https://www.familysearch.org/en/blog/new-ordinances-ready-feature<br/>
Our
	Ward holds a monthly Ward Temple trip.  We target the 1pm Endowment
	session on the 2nd Saturday of each month, however we encourage you
	to attend a time or ordinance that works best for you.<br/>
<br/>
Here
	are resources for scheduling a Temple visit to ensure you have a
	spot in the Endowment session:<br/>

	Texas Temple Reservations</u></font></a><br/>
<br/>
Youth temple
	trips occur quarterly where baptisms and confirmations are
	performed. All members, including new members, are encouraged to
	attend as often as schedules allow to bring the power of the temple
	into their lives.</p></li>
