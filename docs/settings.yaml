quote_of_the_month:
  quote: "When so many around us are burdened with fear and uncertainty, I invite you to make room in your heart for those around you who may be struggling to see the light of the Savior and to feel His love. No gifts will mean as much as acts of pure love you offer to the lonely, the worn down and the weary. These are gifts that remind us and them of the true reason for the season: the gift of Godâ€™s Son, Jesus Christ, who was born to cast out all fear and bring everlasting light and joy to all who follow Him"
  author: "Russell M. Nelson"
