text = "It is important to recognize that Godâ€™s ultimate purpose is our progress. His desire is that we continue 'from grace to grace, until [we receive] a fulness' of all He can give. That requires more than simply being nice or feeling spiritual. It requires faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism of water and of the Spirit, and enduring in faith to the end. One cannot fully achieve this in isolation, so a major reason the Lord has a church is to create a community of Saints that will sustain one another in the 'strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life.'"
