text = "How do we access the quiet miracle that the Lord works as He transforms us, His children, into worthy heirs of the kingdom of God? […] I believe it comes as we yield to the enticings of the Spirit, put off the natural man, and are filled with the love of God. […] All mankind — that includes me, that includes you — we can each have part in the Atonement, the greatest of all God's miracles."
author = "Sydney S. Reynolds"
