text = "Christ not only calms the physical seas, but He can also calm the seas within our minds and souls. […] It is not the velocity of the storm that makes our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ willing to help us. It is our faith in Christ’s calming power and our hastening to call for His help that allows Him to calm our hearts during life’s storms."
